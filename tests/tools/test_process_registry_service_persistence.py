"""A service declaration must survive a gateway restart, and only while alive.

Two invariants, both regressions found against the merged #17 service-node work:

1. **Round-trip.** ``_write_checkpoint`` → ``recover_from_checkpoint`` must
   preserve the five ``service_*`` fields. Without them a background service is
   adopted after a gateway restart as an anonymous process: ``service_name``
   comes back empty, ``collect_service_declarations()`` skips it, and the
   service silently disappears from the cron interflow graph while its process
   is still running. The process is the lease, so the declaration has to outlive
   the gateway exactly as long as the process does.

2. **Liveness is still probed.** Fixing (1) creates the mirror hazard: a
   recovered session's ``exited`` flag is stale (there is no waitable handle),
   so a service whose process died while the gateway was down would be reported
   live forever. ``collect_service_declarations`` must reconcile detached
   sessions against the real PID like every other read path does.

These assert the contract between the two halves (what is persisted must be what
is restored, and liveness must reflect the OS), not any particular field list.
